## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

DeerFlow implements a modular multi-agent system architecture designed for automated research and code analysis. The system is built on LangGraph, enabling a flexible state-based workflow where components communicate through a well-defined message passing system.

### Multi-Agent Collaboration Flow

![DeerFlow Multi-Agent Architecture with Reflection](./assets/architecture.png)

The system employs a streamlined workflow with the following components:

1. **Coordinator**: The entry point that manages the workflow lifecycle

   - Initiates the research process based on user input
   - Delegates tasks to the planner when appropriate
   - Acts as the primary interface between the user and the system

2. **Planner**: Strategic component for task decomposition and planning

   - Analyzes research objectives and creates structured execution plans
   - Determines if enough context is available or if more research is needed
   - Manages the research flow and decides when to generate the final report

3. **Research Node**: An intelligent research component with reflection capabilities:

   - **Independent State Management**: Maintains its own research context and progress
   - **Reflection Analysis**: Self-evaluates research quality and completeness
   - **Knowledge Gap Detection**: Identifies missing information automatically
   - **Adaptive Research**: Generates follow-up queries based on reflection results
   - **Multi-Tool Integration**: Uses web search, crawling, and MCP services

4. **Specialized Agents**: Supporting agents for specific tasks:
   - **Coder**: Handles code analysis, execution, and technical tasks using Python REPL tool
   - Each agent operates within the LangGraph framework with optimized tool access

4. **Reporter**: Final stage processor for research outputs
   - Aggregates findings from the research team
   - Processes and structures the collected information
   - Generates comprehensive research reports

## üîÑ GFLQ Reflection Integration

**SmartDeerFlow** is implementing an advanced reflection mechanism based on GFLQ (Goal-Focused Learning Query) to enhance research quality and system intelligence.

### Overview

The GFLQ reflection integration introduces a self-improvement capability that allows the system to:
- **Analyze research gaps** and identify missing information
- **Generate follow-up queries** to fill knowledge gaps
- **Evaluate research completeness** and suggest improvements
- **Learn from past research patterns** to optimize future queries

### Key Features

- üéØ **Goal-Focused Analysis** - Evaluates research against specific objectives
- üîç **Gap Detection** - Identifies missing information and knowledge gaps
- üîÑ **Iterative Improvement** - Continuously refines research strategies
- üìä **Quality Assessment** - Measures research completeness and relevance
- ‚ö° **Fast Integration** - Experimental MVP approach for rapid deployment


### Benefits

- **Improved Research Quality** - More comprehensive and complete research results
- **Intelligent Adaptation** - System learns and improves research strategies
- **Reduced Manual Intervention** - Automatic gap detection and follow-up
- **Enhanced User Experience** - More relevant and thorough research outputs

> **Details**: [GFLQ Reflection Integration](./docs/GFLQ_REFLECTION_en.md)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Testing
pytest tests/ --cov=deer_flow

# Code Quality
ruff format . && ruff check .

# Debug with LangGraph Studio
# Install: https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-studio
```

### Debugging with LangGraph Studio

DeerFlow uses LangGraph for its workflow architecture. You can use LangGraph Studio to debug and visualize the workflow in real-time.

#### Running LangGraph Studio Locally

DeerFlow includes a `langgraph.json` configuration file that defines the graph structure and dependencies for the LangGraph Studio. This file points to the workflow graphs defined in the project and automatically loads environment variables from the `.env` file.

##### Mac

```bash
# Install uv package manager if you don't have it
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies and start the LangGraph server
uvx --refresh --from "langgraph-cli[inmem]" --with-editable . --python 3.12 langgraph dev --allow-blocking
```

##### Windows / Linux

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
pip install -U "langgraph-cli[inmem]"

# Start the LangGraph server
langgraph dev
```

After starting the LangGraph server, you'll see several URLs in the terminal:

- API: http://127.0.0.1:2024
- Studio UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024
- API Docs: http://127.0.0.1:2024/docs

Open the Studio UI link in your browser to access the debugging interface.

#### Using LangGraph Studio

In the Studio UI, you can:

1. Visualize the workflow graph and see how components connect
2. Trace execution in real-time to see how data flows through the system
3. Inspect the state at each step of the workflow
4. Debug issues by examining inputs and outputs of each component
5. Provide feedback during the planning phase to refine research plans

When you submit a research topic in the Studio UI, you'll be able to see the entire workflow execution, including:

- The planning phase where the research plan is created
- The feedback loop where you can modify the plan
- The research and writing phases for each section
- The final report generation

### Enabling LangSmith Tracing

DeerFlow supports LangSmith tracing to help you debug and monitor your workflows. To enable LangSmith tracing:

1. Make sure your `.env` file has the following configurations (see `.env.example`):

   ```bash
   LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
   LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT="https://api.smith.langchain.com"
   LANGSMITH_API_KEY="xxx"
   LANGSMITH_PROJECT="xxx"
   ```

2. Start tracing and visualize the graph locally with LangSmith by running:
   ```bash
   langgraph dev
   ```

This will enable trace visualization in LangGraph Studio and send your traces to LangSmith for monitoring and analysis.
